## Introduction

- Explanation of TypeScript's growing popularity
- Common challenges and concerns developers face when considering migration
- Overview of incremental approach this guide will take

## Why Migrate to TypeScript?

- Type safety and reduced runtime errors
- Better developer experience?
- Improved code maintainability and documentation
- Team collaboration benefits
- Modern framework compatibility

## Assessing Your JavaScript Codebase

- Evaluate project complexity and scope
- Identify critical components to migrate first
- Take inventory of third-party dependencies
- Set realistic expectations and timelines

## Setting up Your TypeScript Environment

- Install TypeScript and necessary tools
- Configure `tsconfig.json` for your project
- Set up build pipelines
- IDE setup for optimal TypeScript experience

## Incremental Migration Strategies

- The "allow JavaScript" approach
- Use declaration files (`.d.ts`) for existing code
- Gradual file-by-file migration technique
- Implement the `any` type as a temporary measure

## Handling Common Migration Challenges

- Dealing with dynamic typing patterns in JavaScript
- Working with third party libraries without type definitions
- Converting class-based components
- Managing complex object structures

## Advanced Type System Features

- Interfaces vs Types
- Union and intersection types
- Generics basics
- Utility types that simplify migrations

## Testing During Migration

- Maintain test coverage
- Update test files to TypeScript
- Leverage types in your test

## Real World Case Study

- Before and after code examples
- Lessons learned from a successful migration
- Measurable benefits achieved

## Best Practices and Patterns

- Code organization with TypeScript
- Documentation approaches
- Style guides and linting
- Effective use of `strict` mode

## Conclusion

- Summary of migration benefits
- Long term maintenance considerations
- Resources for continued learning
