Creating a modern portfolio website is an essential step for any developer looking to showcase their work. In this post, we'll explore how to build a stunning portfolio using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications. Its features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes make it perfect for portfolio websites.

## Getting Started

To begin, we'll set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. This combination gives us type safety and a utility-first CSS framework for rapid development.

## Design Considerations

When designing a portfolio, it's important to focus on:

- Clean and modern aesthetics
- Responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Easy navigation
